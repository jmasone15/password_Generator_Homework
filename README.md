# Password Generator Homework
This project was assigned to me as a part of the UCF Coding Boot Camp. This project is about buidling off some previously made code to make sure that it works. The goal is to make a successful password generator that takes in user input for the type of password the user needs to generate.

## The Generator
The generator itself can make a randomly generated password between 8 and 128 characters. The user has the choice to edit their generated password as they please with a few options. The generator will ask the user if they want to include lower case characters, upper case characters, numbers, and special characters in their password. Taking into account the requested length of the password, the program will then generate a random passcode with all of thsoe specifications.
